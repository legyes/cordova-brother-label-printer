# Updated Cordova Brother Label Printer Plugin

This is a fork of https://github.com/gordol/cordova-brother-label-printer plugin, with updated Brother SDK an hardcoded QL-810W search.

In config.xml you have to remove the "git+" from plugin path, like:

```
<plugin name="com.threescreens.cordova.plugin.brotherPrinter" spec="https://github.com/legyes/cordova-brother-label-printer.git" />
```

Thank you Thomas Gordon Lowrey IV, you saved my project :)
